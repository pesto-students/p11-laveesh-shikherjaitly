**Hints: ( Refer only if needed)** 

Add the following CSS to the #board selector in styles.css:

- A display property that makes the board's <div> element a grid layout container.
- A grid-template-columns property to create three columns that are all 100px wide.
- A grid-template-rows property to create three rows that are all 100px tall.
- A grid-gap property to create a 10px gap between each of the nine grid cells. 
- A justify-content property that centers the grid horizontally.
