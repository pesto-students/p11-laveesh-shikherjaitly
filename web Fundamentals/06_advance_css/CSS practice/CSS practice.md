Modify the HTML file to produce a webpage for the following poem/song, entitled "Yesterday":

Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday. 

Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say. 

Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay. 

Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday. 

Use CSS to format the webpage so it looks exactly like the screenshot below:
